# BLASTNparse

Description:

This program opens a BLASTN output file, parses out specific information, 
and produces formatted output written to STDOUT

The program starts by opening the input file parsing and 
storing both the query sequence ID and the query length 
and displaying them both to STDOUT. 

It uses regular expressions to pull out precisely the parts of the file that you want.
